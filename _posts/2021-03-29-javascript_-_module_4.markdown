Module 4 is perhaps the most satisfying portion of the whole Software Engineering program at Flatiron school. With all the knowledge and understanding of a Ruby on Rails backend, the only thing that lacks when you land at Module 4, is being able to create dynamic content on the frontend. With the power of Javascript you would be able to manipulate the DOM. A website that responds to the user's interraction is more likely to create an impression than some static HTML pages.

Module 4 starts with the three pillars of front-end web programming which allow you to:

- Manipulate the Document Object Model
- Recognize the manipulation as events
- Communicate the change to the server

With these skills under your belt, you're able to understand how some of the greatest websites in the world are maintained. The very next step is to take a step back and learn about Rails as an API. This knowledge allows you to leverage Rails as a backend serving data to our Javascript, HMTL and CSS frontend. Serializers are an important part of understanding how we manipulate the data sent by the server for our frontend to consume.

The final part of Module 4 goes over understanding ES6 Syntax and diving into Object Orinetated programming. Module 4 goes really deep into Map and Reduce functions before indulging into Classes and Instances of OO in Javascript. Before the project weeks, you're left empowered with a lot of knowledge that can be leveraged to create a single page application of your choice.
