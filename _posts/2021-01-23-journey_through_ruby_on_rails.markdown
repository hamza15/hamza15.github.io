The module 3 of Flatiron's software engineering cohort goes through Rails. The module starts with some introduction and basics of Rails as a framework and leads into restful routes.Next up, CRUD functionality feels much similar to Sinatra and offers mostly an overview along with an introduction to Rails form-tags.

Validations are Forms are the next step in the Rails module which seem like a good place to start for a beginner, given forms are basic blocks for interraction between client and server. Validations allow for user data to be sanitized and prevent an unwanted/invalid interraction. This leads into learning into Layouts and Partials which help you build a consistent website and enable you to write code once and use it across multiple views. This definitely makes you realize the power of Rails and a framework write less code and do more. This realization further leads you into the Helpers chapter which covers separation of concerns between where your logic is and where to display it. Helpers allow you to write code within your models and use those methods to show output in your views which in turn really DRY's up your code.

The restful routes coming from Sinatra are the breeze to work with as Rails manages most of the underlying work for you. Restful routes really help define the logic behind the relationships between your models. Learning nested routing is a key aspect of Rails. The final piece of the puzzle is Authentication which introduces you to OAuth and an amazing Ruby Gem called Omniauth which allows you to use strategies and deploy authentication logic to your application. With all these tools in your toolbox, you're ready to build your first Rails application!
