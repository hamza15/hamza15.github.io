Flatiron took my cohort mates and I on a journey with a massive learning curve. In retrospect, had I known at the start how much effort, dedication and persistance was required to get to where I am now, it would have been very daunting. Ruby felt like a great place to start with it's user interractions and readibility. Sinatra being such a lightweight framework, was a great place to start learning the basics of the web development and its basics like routing and creating data models for expressing relationships between models.

Although Rails felt like Sinatra on steroids, you could really start to sense the power of a backend. Nested routing, rails console, templates for creating models, controllers and even so far creating a base application from one simple command. These were just a few from the long list of Rails powerful attributes we were able to discover. But it was not until we dove into Javascript and rendering elements to the DOM that we truely started to feel like a complete developer that could connect a backend to render data to the frontend. The async nature of javascript answered a lot of questions for my cohort mates and I. 

Our Javascript projects allowed us to display the power of Ruby on Rails backend, connected to a frontend that could use async functions to fetch data from the backend and render it to the DOM. That being said, using javascript did make it feel like it would be tedious to interract with every DOM element and update the state of these elements. React saved us here.

React allowed us to abstract functionality out into components, use virtual DOM, and easy to learn JSX syntax. That with the capabilities of Redux to store the state in a single place and be able to pass the stored state to any/all components of your frontend, makes your applications much faster and easy to scale. 

With React and Redux under my belt, along with all the skills we acquired during the past 10 month, I have really started to feel like a well rounded developer.
