Born and raised in Pakistan, I decided to pursue a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. A couple hackathons, a four year degree and some imposter syndrome later I decided I was meant to do something software. As luck would have it, I stumbled upon an AWS tutorial and 3 months later I was an AWS certified Solutions Architect Associate.

Hence began my journey towards Cloud infrastructure and DevOps. Along this journey I was lucky to surround myself with senior engineers who honed my skills and allowed me to ask stupid questions that often lead to mental breakthroughs. To them I owe much of my success.

After four years of working as a DevOps Engineer, and working on countless teams I often found myself working alongside developers and enabling them to deploy their code on infrastructure. This often required insights into code dependencies and infrastructure optimization to insure quick, safe and durable deployments. Although my infrastructure, networking and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) skills improved immensely, I always felt the desire to fulfill my software engineering knowledge gaps. 

With this Software Engineering program I would like to cover the fundamentals of programming and learn how to write industry standard code. Bringing this skill into my existing career would open a wide range of opportunities for me to grow as an engineer. With these fundamentals in place I would work on practicing Data Structure and Algorithms, which are some of the most common topics in the software engineering space. My goal is to have a portfolio of projects by the end of this cohort that speaks to my skill and hard work.
